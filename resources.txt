To calculate the number of kwh's you use per day

1. List the number of watts for each appliance or electronic device (this is called a “load” for each device). All existing and planned electrical loads should be identified.
2. Estimate the average daily use (the number of hours each day that the appliance or electronic device is running)
3. Multiply the unit's wattage by the number of hours you use it (this will give you a certain amount of “watt-hours”). For example, if you use a 120-watt television for two hours per day. You can multiply the wattage by the number of hours used per day to obtain 240 watt-hours per day.
4. On your electric bill, the electricity is in kilowatt-hours. To compare the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours, we will need to convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours. Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts, divide by 1000 to convert from watt-hours (Wh) to kilowatt-hours (kWh):

240 Wh / 1000 = 0.24 kWh


if you have a solar panel that each produce x kWh of power per day, you would need a full x solar panel to fully power your home if you consume x kwh.









5. To compare these numbers to your electric bill, we need to convert this number to the number of hours that the appliance or device uses per month. For example, 0.24 kWh x 30 days = 7.2 kWh per month.
